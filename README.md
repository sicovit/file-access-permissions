<p>
Start by connecting to your Windows Server through Remote Desktop. Choose or create a folder you want to share over the network, then right-click it, go to Properties, and enable sharing under the Sharing tab by selecting Advanced Sharing. Give the shared folder a name and adjust the basic share permissions to allow users to read or change files.

After that, go to the Security tab to configure NTFS permissions, which control more detailed access, like who can open, modify, or delete files. It's recommended to create an Active Directory security group, add your users to it, and assign permissions to that group instead of individual users. This makes permission management much easier and more scalable.

<p>
 Use Group Policy to automatically map the network share to usersâ€™ computers when they log in, so they can access it without having to manually browse the network. With this setup, users can securely access shared folders over the network with the correct level of permission.
